            The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – 
            Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers 
            joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely 
            signing on to write the script a month later. The film is a 
            conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the 
            story arcs of several main characters. Its plot revisits several 
            moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings 
            throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood 
            Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back 
            with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming 
            took place in the Metro and downtown Atlanta areas, New York State, 
            Scotland, and England. The official title was announced in December 
            2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one 
            of the most expensive films ever produced.
